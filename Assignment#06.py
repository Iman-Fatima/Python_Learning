#     Use different Comparison Operators
#         Equal to
#         Greater than or equal to
#         Not equal to
#         Less than or equal to

# Note
#     Output result of all of the above operations using f-string with proper string message. 
#     e.g. Result of Operand_1 == Operand_2 = calulated_result
#     Comment your outputs in the program
