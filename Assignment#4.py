# Create a Mini Calculator that can operate on two operands and can perform:
#     Addition
#     Subtraction
#     Multiplication
#     Division
#     Floor Division
#     Exponentiation
#     # Modulus

# --> ADDITION:
number_1 = 5
number_2 = 10
number_3 = number_1 + number_2
print(f'The sum of the given numbers are: {number_3}')
# The sum of the given numbers are: 15




# --> SUBTRACTION:
number_1 = 5
number_2 = 10
number_3 = number_1 - number_2
print(f'The subtraction of the given numbers are: {number_3}')
# The subtraction of the given numbers are: 15
